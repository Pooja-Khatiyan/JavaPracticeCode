//1--What is the purpose of a constructor in Java?
//a)initialize the class variable     b)restrict the unnecessary object creation
//2--How does a constructor differ from a regular method in Java?
//regular method contains business logic and it can return	
//3--Can a Java class have multiple constructors? If so, how are they differentiated?
//yes,concept is called constructor overloading,by passing different parameters
//4--What happens if a constructor is not defined in a Java class?
// If you donâ€™t implement any constructor in your class, the Java compiler inserts default constructor into your code on your behalf. You will not 
//see the default constructor in your source code (the .java file) as it is inserted during compilation and present in the bytecode (.class file).
//5--Can a constructor call other methods or constructors within the same class?
