public class Car {

}
//Create a Java class named "Car" with the following instance variables:
//make (String)
//model (String)
//year (int)
//Create a constructor for the Car class that takes in the make, model, and year as parameters and initializes the instance variables.
//Create a default constructor for the Car class that sets the make, model, and year to "Unknown".
//Create a main method that creates three instances of the Car class using both constructors and prints out their information.

//Questions:

//1--What is the purpose of a default constructor in Java?
//to create object & initialized value in case we doesn't created const..
//2--Can a default constructor take in parameters?
//no then it become const.. overloading
//3--Can a constructor be overloaded in Java? If so, what does it mean to overload a constructor?
//yes--it permit the object creation with different parameter
//4--Can you create an object of a Java class without calling a constructor?
//no that is not possible ,without const.. we can't create obj of the class 
//5--How are instance variables accessed and modified outside of the class they are defined in?
//by defining them publics
